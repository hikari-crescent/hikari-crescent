# Creating a Bot Application

Before you can start programming, you need to create a discord bot application.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

  -  **Create a Bot Application**

    ---

      - Navigate to [The Discord Application Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), then click on the blue button that says "New Application".

      ![New Application](resources/new_application.png){width = 800}
      
      - Click on the "Bot" button.
      
      ![Bot Button](resources/bot_button.png){ width=250 }
    
      - Click on the blue "Add Bot" button, and pick a memorable name!

      ---
      **Finding your token** (For rest bots)
      ---

      Navigate to the bot page. Press the "Reset Token" button to claim your token. You may need to enter a authentication code. Write this down and don't share it to anybody. It will give them access to your bot!

  - **Invite the Bot**
    
    ---
    - Navigate to the oauth2 url generator.

      <img src="../resources/oauth2.png" width="250"/>

    - Select the bot scope.

      <img src="../resources/scope.png" width="500"/>

    - Scroll farther down to the bottom of the page. Press the copy button.

      <img src="../resources/copy.png" width="500"/>


    Paste this URL into your web browser. You will get an invite page for your bot. Add the bot to a server you are going to develop it on.

!!! note

    Setting up a REST bot on the discord developer portal is very complicated, so this guide does not cover that. Please read the Discord documentation if you want to use a REST bot.

## Basics

Copy this code into a python file, and run with `python filename.py`.

=== "Gateway"

    ```python
    import crescent
    import hikari

    bot = hikari.GatewayBot("YOUR_TOKEN")
    client = crescent.Client(bot)

    @client.include
    @crescent.command(name="say")
    class Say:
        word = crescent.option(str, "The word to say")

        async def callback(self, ctx: crescent.Context) -> None:
            await ctx.respond(self.word)

    bot.run()
    ```

=== "REST"

    ```python
    import crescent
    import hikari

    bot = hikari.RESTBot("YOUR_TOKEN")
    client = crescent.Client(bot)

    @client.include
    @crescent.command(name="say")
    class Say:
        word = crescent.option(str, "The word to say")

        async def callback(self, ctx: crescent.Context) -> None:
            await ctx.respond(self.word)

    bot.run()
    ```

## Tooling
It is recommended to use a typechecker when working with crescent. Both the [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) and [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) typecheckers are supported. The developer recommends pyright if you don't know what to pick.

!!! warning

    Crescent does not throw exceptions for issues a typechecker would catch. Use a typechecker.

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! At this point you should have a bot. Now you should check out the [guides](../guides), or if want to jump straight into coding, check out the [template project](https://github.com/hikari-crescent/template) for some quick examples.
