## Installation
Crescent is supported in python3.8+.
```
pip install hikari-crescent
```

## Usage
Crescent uses signature parsing to generate your commands. Creating commands is as easy as adding typehints!

```python
import crescent

bot = crescent.Bot("YOUR_TOKEN")

# Include the command in your bot - don't forget this
@bot.include
# Create a slash command
@crescent.command
async def say(ctx: crescent.Context, word: str):
    await ctx.respond(word)

bot.run()
```

Information for arguments can be provided using the `Annotated` type hint.
See [this example](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent/blob/main/examples/basic/basic.py) for more information.

```python
# python 3.9 +
from typing import Annotated as Atd

# python 3.8
from typing_extensions import Annotated as Atd

@bot.include
@crescent.command
async def say(ctx: crescent.Context, word: Atd[str, "The word to say"]):
    await ctx.respond(word)
```
