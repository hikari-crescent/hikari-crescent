## Installation
Crescent is supported in python3.8+.
```
pip install hikari-crescent
```

## Usage
Signature parsing can be used for simple commands.

```python
import crescent

bot = crescent.Bot("YOUR_TOKEN")

# Include the command in your bot - don't forget this
@bot.include
# Create a slash command
@crescent.command
async def say(ctx: crescent.Context, word: str):
    await ctx.respond(word)

bot.run()
```

Information for arguments can be provided using the `Annotated` type hint.
See [this example](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent/blob/main/examples/basic/basic.py) for more information.

```python
# python 3.9 +
from typing import Annotated as Atd

# python 3.8
from typing_extensions import Annotated as Atd

@bot.include
@crescent.command
async def say(ctx: crescent.Context, word: Atd[str, "The word to say"]) -> None:
    await ctx.respond(word)
```

Complicated commands, such as commands with many modifiers on options or autocomplete on several options, should
use [class commands](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent/blob/main/examples/basic/command_classes.py).
Class commands allow you to declare a command similar to how you declare a dataclass. The option function takes a
type followed by the description, then optional information.

```python
@bot.include
@crescent.command(name="say")
class Say:
    word = crescent.option(str, "The word to say")

    async def callback(self, ctx: crescent.Context) -> None:
        await ctx.respond(self.word)
```

### Typing to Option Types Lookup Table 
| Type | Option Type |
|---|---|
| `str` | Text |
| `int` | Integer |
| `bool` | Boolean |
| `float` | Number |
| `hikari.User` | User |
| `hikari.Role` | Role |
| `crescent.Mentionable` | Role or User |
| Any Hikari channel type. | Channel. The options will be the channel type and its subclasses. |
| `Union[Channel Types]` (functions only) | Channel. ^ |
| `List[Channel Types]` (classes only) | Channel. ^ |
| `hikari.Attachment` | Attachment |


### Error Handling
Errors that are raised by a command can be handled by `crescent.catch_command`.

```python
class MyError(Exception):
    ...

@bot.include
@crescent.catch_command(MyError)
async def on_err(exc: MyError, ctx: crescent.Context) -> None:
    await ctx.respond("An error occurred while running the command.")

@bot.include
@crescent.command
async def my_command(ctx: crescent.Context):
    raise MyError()
```

### Events
```python
import hikari

@bot.include
@crescent.event
async def on_message_create(event: hikari.MessageCreateEvent):
    if event.message.author.is_bot:
        return
    await event.message.respond("Hello!")
```
Using crescent's event decorator lets you use
crescent's [event error handling system](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent/blob/main/examples/error_handling/basic.py#L27).

# Extensions
Crescent has 2 builtin extensions.

- [crescent-ext-cooldowns](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent/tree/main/examples/ext/cooldowns) - Allows you to add sliding window rate limits to your commands.
- [crescent-ext-tasks](https://github.com/magpie-dev/hikari-crescent/tree/main/examples/ext/tasks) - Schedules background tasks using loops or cronjobs.

These extensions can be installed with pip.

- [crescent-ext-docstrings](https://github.com/Lunarmagpie/crescent-ext-docstrings) - Lets you use docstrings to write descriptions for commands and options.
- [crescent-ext-kebabify](https://github.com/Lunarmagpie/crescent-ext-kebabify) - Turns your command names into kebabs!
